Two phases

Graphs for both phases
Phase one is loading
Phase two is removing the weight 

Identify yield point or maximum collapse load

Make calculations for theoretical results

Then. Compare to practical results 

Three beams
One is simply supported beam
Supported from both ends and free to move on x and y axis 
Cantilever beans are fixed from one and one end only 
Final one is fixed which is fixed from both sides

Take measurements of the width of the beam then take the depth of the beam. The width is the horizontal and the depth is the vertical measurement of the beam. The with is 7 mm
The depth is 8mm

Full length is 88cm ignore effective length. It’s the same as full length. 

Load was applied and when applied the beam will bend. It was recorded on a force indicator. The displacement and deformation was recorded on the middle of the beam. The exact point of symmetry. 

The material of the beam was carbon steel
Applied force for every 2mm is 10 newtons. 

If excessive force is applied then the energy stored will be exceeded and the beam cannot resist back and will be permanently deformed 

Hookes law is that the more the force is increased then the more the displacement is present or vice versa or up to a maximum limit. Refer to graph 


The yield point is next to the maximum collapse load and will permanently deform. The linear area is called the elastic limit. Once passed then the permanent elastic deformation will happen. 

The material is CARBON STEEL

Three experiments will now be done.

Simple, propped cantilever, and fixed beams. 

First is the simple beam. 

Force indicator 
Displacement indicator
Displacement sensor

On removal
In every 20 newtons the displacement will be recorded. The maximum until reaching zero force applied which will give the permanent deformation.

What to do for theory calculations 

Maximum permanent deflection 
Before that we must calculate the moment of inertia 

Then maximum bending moment 
Then bending stress

Repeat x3

Moment of inertia for 1 should be (width of beam x depth of beam^3)/12

For maximum permanent deflection should be

(Maximum forcelength of beam^3 ) / 48ei

E is Young’s modulus which is 2.110^5
i is moment of inertia 

(For cantilever)
Maximum bending moment and bending stress

Maximum permanent deflection is (7maximum forcelength of beam^3 ) / 768ei

Maximum permanent deflection is = (maximum force applied * length^3) / 192ei
