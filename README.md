Hello, welcome to this repository! I understand the name may not be very 'descriptive', however this is the codebase used for my second Statics lab report.

After collecting lab data, I started work on this code in order to handle the calculations for myself, as opposed to doing everything by pen and paper. Just easier that way.

There are some files that may have been expunged from this library; but I cannot say for now as I have not completed the codebase yet.

However, if they do exist, they will be well-documented in this section to dispel any possible accusations of academic misconduct and plagiarisation.
