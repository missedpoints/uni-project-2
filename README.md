A note- I had to rewrite the Statics lab report word document due to data loss caused by Windows corrupting on the same day as the submission was meant to take place, so I apologise if anything is missing on the Word document as far as data goes. Rest assured, I was able to re-write it and have completely compiled all the data from the Lab here. 

Hello, welcome to this repository! I understand the name may not be very 'descriptive', however this is the codebase used for my second Statics lab report.

After collecting lab data, I started work on this code in order to handle the calculations for myself, as opposed to doing everything by pen and paper. Just easier that way.

There are some files that may have been expunged from this library; but I cannot say for now as I have not completed the codebase yet.

However, if they do exist, they will be well-documented in this section to dispel any possible accusations of academic misconduct and plagiarisation. 

just realized I wrote this already. I managed to fix my desktop, however the data loss unfortunately was permanent ðŸ˜­ --> A final note, at 2 AM, March 17th, my Desktop decided to kick the bucket, so the entire Report had to be rewritten (but the code was safe, thanks to it being in this repository) so I apologize for the report being so low quality compared to my regular work.
